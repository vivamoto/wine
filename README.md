# Wine Type and Quality Prediction
Capstone project of HarvardX [Data Science Professional Certificate](https://courses.edx.org/dashboard/programs/3c32e3e0-b6fe-4ee4-bd4f-210c6339e074/) program

This repository contains the report and code of the capstone project of HarvardX’s Data Science Professional Certificate program.

HarvardX’s Data Science Professional Certificate program covers several steps in a data science project, such as data wrangling, data exploration and visualization, probability and statistics, R language, Rmarkdown, and machine learning. This capstone project briefly applies each of these concepts in a real world case study.

The goal is to predict the type of wine, red or white, and quality applying the lessons learned in the program.

`code.R` - R code used to build and evaluate the machine learning models.  
`report.Rmd` - R Markdown code used to create the PDF and HTML reports.  
`report.pdf` - Technical report with the model building and evaluation.
